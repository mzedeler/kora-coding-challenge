# Ruby scaffold for coding challenge

Inital stubs for challenge answers are in `lib` and tests are located in `spec`.

How to set up:
 * bundle install

How to run:
 * bundle exec guard

`guard` reruns the tests when a file changes, so you can just leave it running in
a terminal when you are working on the challenges. Type `exit` followed by enter
to exit guard. If you want to run the tests manually, just run `bundle exec rspec`.

# Coding challenges for Kora teams

Welcome to the Kora teams Christmas coding challenges 2023!

The purpose of these challenges is to give everyone an excuse to discuss
code quality in a different setting with disposable code.

Before reading the challenges, note that we want you to solve them one by
one in ascending order. You can find scaffolding for Ruby and JavaScript
in the corresponding directories. The scaffolding includes tests that are
specific to each challenge.

We've picked the following three challenges:

## Challenge 1: binary strings

Given a string of digits, you should replace any digit below 5 with '0' and
all other digits with '1'. Return the resulting string.

Examples:

  '2'    => '0'
  '5'    => '1'
  '2255' => '0011'


## Challenge 2: difference between pairs
Find the sum the differences between consecutive pairs in the array in
descending order.

Examples:

  [2, 1, 10]   => (10 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 8 + 1 = 9
  [2, 3, 4, 1]Â => (4 - 3) + (3 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 3


## Challenge 3: longest substring without repeating characters
Find the longest substring without any repeating chars in the input
string.

Examples:

  'aa'                   => 'a'
  'aaabb'                => 'ab'
  'bbbaaaverylongstrapo' => 'averylongst'
